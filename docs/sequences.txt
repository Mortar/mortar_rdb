Sequences
=========

Many applications require non-repeating sequences of integer numbers.
While some database engines provide structures for this purpose, others,
such as MySQL and SQLite do not.

Alternatively, you may wish to have a more global source of unique
integer identifiers that you share across several database servers.

For either of these cases, you can use the sequence support provided
by :mod:`mortar_rdb`.

Usage is very simple. During application configuration, register
sequences at the same time as you register the session to use for a
database:

.. invisible-code-block: python

  from mortar_rdb import register_session, get_session
  from mortar_rdb.sequence.generic import sequences
  import transaction
  register_session(db_url, 'setup')
  with transaction.manager:
    session = get_session('setup')
    sequences.create(session.bind)

.. code-block:: python

  from mortar_rdb import register_session, get_session
  from mortar_rdb.sequence import register_sequence

  import transaction

  register_session(db_url)
  with transaction.manager:
      session = get_session()
      register_sequence('seq1', session)
      register_sequence('seq2', session)

You'll notice that you need to manage a database transaction when you
call :func:`~mortar_rdb.sequence.register_sequence`, either using the
:mod:`transaction` package or by manually calling
:meth:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session.commit` after the call. This is
because registering a sequence, certainly in the default
:class:`~mortar_rdb.sequence.generic.SequenceImplementation`, may require
creating a row in a table.

Once registered, whenever you need some unique integers in application
code, get hold of the sequence and call its
:meth:`~mortar_rdb.interfaces.ISequence.next` method::

  >>> from mortar_rdb import get_session
  >>> from mortar_rdb.sequence import get_sequence
  >>> seq1 = get_sequence('seq1')
  >>> seq2 = get_sequence('seq2')
  >>> session = get_session()
  >>> seq1.next(session)
  1
  >>> seq1.next(session)
  2
  >>> seq1.next(session)
  3
  >>> seq2.next(session)
  1

.. note:: The default implementation used by
  :func:`~mortar_rdb.sequence.register_sequence` is 
  :class:`mortar_rdb.sequence.generic.SequenceImplementation`.

  This uses a table called ``sequences`` in the database which needs
  to be created before 
  you first call :func:`~mortar_rdb.sequence.register_sequence`. If you
  are using :mod:`mortar_rdb.controlled` then you can use the source from
  ``mortar_rdb.sequence.generic.source`` as part of your
  :class:`~mortar_rdb.controlled.Config` to take care of table creation.

  Also, please note that this implementation may cause contention on
  the table in question. If your database engine provides native
  sequences, an implementation that used those would be gratefully
  received!

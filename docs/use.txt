Basic Usage
===========

This narrative documentation covers the use case of developing an
application from scratch that uses :mod:`mortar_rdb` to interact with a
relational database through development and testing.

Development
-----------

For this narrative, we'll assume we're developing our application in a
python package called :mod:`sample` that uses the following model:

.. topic:: sample/model.py
 :class: write-file

 ::

  from mortar_rdb import declarative_base
  from mortar_rdb.controlled import Config, scan
  from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Integer, String

  Base = declarative_base()

  class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'user'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(20))

  source = scan('sample')
  config = Config(source)

There's nothing particularly special about this model other than that
we've used :func:`mortar_rdb.declarative_base` to obtain a declarative base rather
than calling :func:`sqlalchemy.ext.declarative.declarative_base`. This
means that multiple python packages can all use the same declarative
base, without having to worry about which package first defines the
base.

This also means that all tables and models used in our application,
regardless of the package they are defined in, can refer to each
other.

To allow us to take advantage of the schema controls provided by
:mod:`mortar_rdb`, we have also defined a :class:`~mortar_rdb.controlled.Config`
with a :class:`~mortar_rdb.controlled.Source` returned from a
:func:`~mortar_rdb.controlled.scan`. The source is defined seperately to
the configuration for two reasons:

- it allows a configuration in another package to use the source defined
  here, which encapsulates all the tables managed by this package.

- it makes it easier to write tests for migration scripts for the 
  tables managed by this package.

.. highlight:: python

To use the above model, we have the following view code:

.. topic:: sample/views.py
 :class: write-file

 ::

   from mortar_rdb import getSession
   from sample.model import User
   
   def add_user(name):
       session = getSession()
       session.add(User(name=name))

   def edit_user(id,name):
       session = getSession()
       user = session.query(User).filter(User.id == id).one()
       user.name = name

When using :mod:`mortar_rdb`, the session is obtained by calling
:func:`mortar_rdb.getSession`. This allows the provision of the session to
be independent of its use, which makes testing and deploying to
different environments easier.

It is also advised that application code does not manage committing or
rollback of database transactions via the session unless absolutely
necessary. These actions should be the responsibility of the framework
running the application.

For the purposes of this narrative, we will use the following micro
framework:

.. topic:: sample/run.py
 :class: write-file

 ::

   from mortar_rdb import registerSession
   from sample import views
   from sample.config import db_url
   from sample.model import config

   import sys 
   import transaction

   def main():
       registerSession(db_url)
       name = sys.argv[1]
       args = sys.argv[2:]
       with transaction.manager:
           getattr(views, name)(*args)
       print "Ran %r with %r" % (name, args)

   if __name__=='__main__':
       main()  

Although there's not much to it, the above framework shows the
elements you will need to plug in to whatever framework you choose to
use.

The main one of these is the call to :func:`~mortar_rdb.registerSession`
which sets up the components necessary for :func:`~mortar_rdb.getSession` to
return a :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` object.

The example framework is also shown to manage these sessions using the
:mod:`transaction` package. Should your framework not use this
package, you are strongly suggested to read the documentation for
:func:`~mortar_rdb.registerSession` in detail to make sure you pass the
correct parameters to get the behaviour required by your framework.

Testing
-------

It's alway a good idea to write automated tests, preferably before
writing the code under test. :mod:`mortar_rdb` aids this by providing the
:mod:`mortar_rdb.testing` module.

The following example shows how to provides minimal coverage using
:func:`mortar_rdb.testing.registerSession` and illustrates how the
abstraction of configuring a session from obtaining a session in
:mod:`mortar_rdb` makes testing easier:

.. topic:: sample/tests.py
 :class: write-file

 ::

  from mortar_rdb import getSession
  from mortar_rdb.testing import registerSession
  from sample.model import User, config
  from sample.views import add_user, edit_user
  from unittest import TestCase

  class Tests(TestCase):

       def setUp(self):
           registerSession(config=config)

       def test_add_user(self):
           # code under test
           add_user('Mr Test')
           # checks
           session = getSession()
           user = session.query(User).one()
           self.assertEqual('Mr Test',user.name)

       def test_edit_user(self):
           # setup
           session = getSession()
           session.add(User(id=1,name='Mr Chips'))
           # code under test
           edit_user('1','Mr Fish')
           # checks
           user = session.query(User).one()
           self.assertEqual('Mr Fish',user.name)

If you wish to run these tests against a particular database, rather
than using the default in-memory SQLite database, then set the
``DB_URL`` enviroment variable to the SQLAlchemy url of the database
you'd like to use. For example, if you run your tests with `nose`__
and are developing in a unix-like environment against a MySQL
database, you could do::

  $ DB_URL=mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test nosetests

Release
-------

With the application developed and tested, it is now time to release
and deploy it. Users of :mod:`mortar_rdb` are encouraged to create a small
database management script making use of
:class:`mortar_rdb.controlled.Scripts`.

Here's is an example for the above model:

.. topic:: sample/db.py
 :class: write-file

 ::

   from mortar_rdb.controlled import Scripts
   from sample.config import db_url, is_production
   from sample.model import config
   
   scripts = Scripts(db_url, config, not is_production)

   if __name__=='__main__':
       scripts()

.. invisible-code-block: python

  # now that we've got all files on disk, run the tests
  from sample.tests import Tests
  run_tests(Tests, 2)

.. highlight:: bash

This script can be used to create all tables required by the
applications :class:`~mortar_rdb.controlled.Config` as follows::

  $ bin/db create
  For database at sqlite:////test.db:

  Creating the following tables:
  user

Other commands are are provided by :class:`~mortar_rdb.controlled.Scripts`
and both the command line help, obtained with the ``--help`` option to
either the script or any of its commands, and documentation are well
worth a read.

So, the view code, database model, tests and framework are all now
ready and the database has been created. The framework is now ready to
use::

  $ bin/run add_user test
  Ran 'add_user' with ['test']
